The following pre-processing was applied to each image:

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Randomly crop between 0 and 30 percent of the image
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -40 and +40 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 10 percent of pixels
